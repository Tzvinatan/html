<p>Origins of flamenco: Flamenco music was likely<br> inspired by the music of India, brought to the European<br> continent by members of the gypsy culture. It is widely believed that the Roma<br> people migrated to southern Spain from Rajasthan, in northwest India, sometime <br>between the ninth and fourteenth centuries, bringing with them a large repertoire<br> of songs, dances, and musical instruments, including tambourines,<br> bells, and wooden castanets. Over time, these Indian folkloric traditions mingled<br> with the musical traditions of the Sephardic Jews and the Moors,<br> resulting in what is now known as flamenco. There are some, however,<br> who believe that flamenco existed in Andalusía long before the Roma arrived<br> from India.

<h4>The golden age of flamenco
</h4>

<p>The Golden Age of flamenco: Most experts agree<br> that the golden age of flamenco happened<br> sometime between the late eighteenth and <br>early nineteenth centuries.<br> Like other folkloric traditions,<br> flamenco began as a deeply private,<br> family-orientated tradition.<br> It was first popularized in 1842<br> at Café sin Nombre, in Seville.<br> The first of many flamenco venues<br> (called tablaos) to open in Spanish cities,<br> Café sin Nombre put on flamenco performances<br> and invited patrons to watch the spectacle.<br> While this generated the beginnings of a<br> flamenco performing industry,<br> it also led to what some saw as a decline<br> in the cultural superiority of the art form.<br> In 1922, Spanish poet Federico García<br> Lorca and composer Manuel de Falla created<br> the first flamenco competition in an attempt to<br> restore what they saw as the “purity” of flamenco.<br> With the national spotlight on flamenco<br>, the art form grew and flourished.
